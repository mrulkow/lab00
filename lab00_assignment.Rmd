### Instructions

Complete the Lab Exercises and Dive Deeper questions below. Typically, there will be seven Lab Exercises (graded out of 2 points each) and two Dive Deeper questions (graded out of 3 points each) - all of them graded for *correctness*. For this first assignment, there are only five Lab Exercises and all questions will be graded for completeness. Upon completion, follow the submission instructions at the bottom of this document.

### Background

For this lab, we will continue working with the `penguins` data set. As a reminder, the `penguins` data set contains information on 333 penguins collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. See the References section at the bottom of the lab resources document for more information.

Use the following code chunk to read in the data set. 

```{r readpenguins}
penguins <- read.csv("penguins.csv")
```

For Lab 0, there are only five questions and they will be graded for completeness. 

> **1.** In the code chunk below, multiply 250 by your lab's section number. 

```{r exercise1}
